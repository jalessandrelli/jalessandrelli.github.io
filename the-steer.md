<span>Recorded in Portland, OR, and hosted by Jeff Alessandrelli and Joshua James Amberson from 2018-2020, [*The Steer*](https://the-steer.com/) featured musicians talking about their favorite writers and books and writers talking about their favorite musicians and albums. Conversations often went elsewhere and following each talk was a playlist of songs or sounds discussed during the interview. Two regular seasons of the show were aired and episodes now appear intermittently.</span><span>The Steer is broadcast on [Dublab Radio](http://dublab.com/) and on the airwaves at KZUT 99.1 FM Los Angeles (available to 1.4 million listeners in the San Fernando Valley), recorded at [KBOO Radio](https://kboo.fm), and can be accessed via [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-steer/id144444308?mt=2), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-steer), Player FM, Pocketcasts, or anywhere else podcasts are found.</span> -->

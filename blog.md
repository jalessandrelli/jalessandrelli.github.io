From 2016-2021 I was a staff blogger for *The Kenyon Review*, contributing short essays and reviews and conducting author interviews. Find more here: [The Kenyon Review blog](https://www.kenyonreview.org/author/jeff-alessandrelli/)

I started a [Tumblr](https://jeffalessandrelli.tumblr.com/) in 2008 and still post on it. I can't believe it either. Circa 2025 I'm also now on [Substack](https://jalessandrelli.substack.com/).
